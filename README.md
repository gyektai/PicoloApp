# PicoloApp
Application version of my picolo game. Much further built out than the web version

It's a drinking game. I'm in college. What else do you expect?

Developed using React-Native. Incorporates context, hooks, state, useEffect, react-spring, svg, all the standard stuff.

The game goes through a deck of cards and either calls players out by name or as a group to do tasks, answer questions, and drink. 

Similar games exist on the app store, but my thesis to make this was that all of the existing ones weren't actually playable due to bad cards. But that turned out to by my hang up as well, and why I didn't finish, pollish, and publish it. Also potential liability and app store restrictions against alcohol consumption.


The design actually looks pretty good in my opinion. Here are some grabs from it
